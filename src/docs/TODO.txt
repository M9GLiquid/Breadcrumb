 *  Add functionality of mouse(buttons)
 *  Load Capability
 *  Save Capability
 *  Add, 2048 game using the framework
 *  LevelReader very inefficient as it loads from the file each level pass
    - Should keep a few levels in memory instead for increased performance.
 *  Add JUnit testings
 *  Restructure the code for AudioObserver to go with GameObserver, Look into Strategy part of the pattern for this.

Bugs
 *  Load works different from StartMenu and PauseMenu?
    Even if no file is found will load you into a position?
    - Event due to level is incrementing on load!
